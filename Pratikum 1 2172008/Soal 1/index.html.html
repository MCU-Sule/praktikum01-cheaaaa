            We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes, <br>
            But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes. <br>
            One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br>
            Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br>
            You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,<br>
            Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.<br>

            <u>If</u> the plural of man is always called men, <br>
            Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
            <u>If</u> I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br>
            And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br>
            <u>If</u> one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br>
            Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?<br>

            Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>
            Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
            And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br>
            We speak of a brother and also of brethren,<br>
            But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br>
            Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>
            <del>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</del><hr><br><br>
